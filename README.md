# 3D-Sorting-Visualizer

- Made in Rust + Bevy
- Made mostly for wasm32, but should be able to be compiled on other targets (at least Windows)
- Just messing around for now :)

## Building
- Use Trunk to build: 
    - `Trunk build --release`: builds the wasm, html, css, js
    - `Trunk serve --open`: builds, starts up a server, and opens browser to the local address
